# FinanceTracker

A personal finance tracker for logging income and expenses, visualizing spending, and hitting monthly budget goals — built with React and Supabase.

---

## Problem Statement

Most people have no structured, lightweight way to track personal finances without subscribing to bloated paid apps. FinanceTracker solves this with a single, focused web app that lets any individual:

- Log every income and expense in one place
- See exactly where their money is going through clear visual breakdowns
- Set a monthly spending limit per category and watch progress in real time

Target user: anyone who wants clarity over their personal spending without signing up for an expensive finance product.

## Features

- Email + password authentication (Supabase Auth) with protected routes
- Dashboard with monthly income, expenses, and net-balance summary cards
- Expenses-by-category pie chart (current month)
- Income vs. expenses bar chart (last 6 months)
- Recent transactions feed on the dashboard
- Full transactions CRUD with month / category / type filters
- Floating "Add transaction" button and modal form with auto-focused title field
- Inline edit + delete (with confirmation) for every transaction
- Per-category monthly budget goals with progress bars (green → yellow → red)
- "Over budget!" warning when spending exceeds the limit
- Responsive, mobile-first Tailwind UI
- Loading spinners, empty states, and inline error messages everywhere
- Lazy-loaded routes with React Router v6 + Suspense
- Row Level Security — users can only read and write their own rows

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ishanavasthi/fintracker
cd fintracker
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in your Supabase credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

Find these values in your Supabase project dashboard under **Project Settings → API**.

### 4. Set up the database

In the Supabase SQL editor, run the schema SQL provided in the project (creates `transactions` and `budgets` tables with RLS policies).

Then, under **Authentication → Providers → Email**, disable **"Confirm email"** for local development so new signups can log in immediately.

### 5. Start the dev server

```bash
npm start
```

The app runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 6. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

**Rules of the architecture:**

- Pages never call Supabase directly — always go through `/services`
- Hooks wrap services and expose `{ data, loading, error, refetch }`
- Components are presentational — no direct Supabase calls
